        <h1>Amazon - Book Series Pages</h1>
        <h4>Summer 2014<br>
            Role: UX/UI designer</h4>
        <!-- <p>In 2014 I spent a number of months contracting with Amazon on the Universal Shopping Experience team. While there I worked on a range of projects that focused on markets like the fashion industry and the book & textbook industry, as well as the general online retail. I was able to adapt to a new work environment quickly, diving into projects already well under way. 

        <p>Most of the time I needed to further the effort that a previous designer had started. I would take feedback from stakeholders and team members, then drive the user experience and design solutions to a place that met the goals of the project. Other times I was involved in future-thinking projects, participating in brainstorming and pitching of ideas, research and analysis, then prototyping and testing the ideas we came up with.</p>

        <p>An example of the work I did during this time is the book series details page. It's designed to show all the books in a series, allowing the customer to view and purchase them from one page. I was handed this project mid stream and worked closely with the project manager and stakeholders to flesh out the details of every aspect of the layout and user experience. It represents the kind of high-level thinking coupled with constant attention to detail that I try to bring to every project I work on.</p> -->

        <p>I worked on a number of projects for Amazon including UI designs for the buy box, product images, and choose-a-size features for the universal shopping experience team. I pitched ideas for Prime Wardrobe and explored solutions for fit issues with the fashion team, and I worked on designs for textbook and book series pages for the books team. A lot of this work is still under NDA, but I can focus in on book series pages which are now live as an example of how I worked while I was there.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Many popular books are part of a series, yet Amazon didn’t have an easy way for the shopper to see and purchase each book in a series. The proposed solution was to create a page where all the books in a series could be seen at once and added to a shopper’s cart without interruption.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I was handed this project after it started and was given rough draft designs that I needed to work from as the project evolved. The visual design was there but the UX work hadn’t been done and a lot of states were missing. The first thing I did was ask questions, taking note of the team’s jargon and working dynamics as well as what was motivating the project and who we needed to get buy in, in order for it to succeed. I also listened to each feature request and asked clarifying questions, so I could understand the business and audience I was designing for.</p>

                    alt=""></div>
        <h5>Example of a user flow, showing each step a shopper would take from search, to book series page, to checkout.</h5>
        <p>Next, I created user flows and interactive mock-ups in a format that the team preferred when they reviewed product designs, making sure to adapt to Amazon’s existing process so that my team looked their best when presenting to their bosses and other influential stakeholders. I made sure to be thorough in my user flows so that any unseen issues can be raised and addressed, exploring use cases from beginning to end, thinking about both the desktop and mobile experience, and showing different states of UI features and content scenarios.</p>

                    images/amz-04_3x.jpg 1650w,
                    images/amz-04_4x.jpg 2200w"
                    src="images/amz-04_1x.jpg" 
                    alt=""></div>
        <h5>Example of an interactive mock-up with a list of features and states that were built out on the left.</h5>
        <p>Part of my role was to support the work of the Project Manager as she championed this project across internal teams and stakeholders. I helped explain and defend our design decisions in meetings when the Kindle team was skeptical of participating and addressed their issues in my designs. I worked with the technical constraints of the search team, getting on the calendar of a search image expert to answer questions on how my designs should comply with their technology. These efforts went a long way to unblock the project and show stakeholders that it was viable to launch. I also worked with a remote dev team in a different time zone and who spoke English as a second language, communicating effectively, and creating image assets to their specs and on time for their schedule.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>When my involvement in the project ended, I handed over design and UX files that were in good order, and made a series of deliverables that were available for all team members to view and could be relied upon as documentation of all the latest design decisions. The feature went live a year later in 2015. Here is a sample of my final design for the book series page. The latest version can be seen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00CJG28U8/ref=dp_st_059035342X" target="_blank">live on Amazon.com</a>.</p>
