        <h1>Amazon - Book Series Pages</h1>
        <h4>Summer 2014<br>
            Role: UX/UI designer</h4>
        <!-- <p>In 2014 I spent a number of months contracting with Amazon on the Universal Shopping Experience team. While there I worked on a range of projects that focused on markets like the fashion industry and the book & textbook industry, as well as the general online retail. I was able to adapt to a new work environment quickly, diving into projects already well under way. 

        <p>Most of the time I needed to further the effort that a previous designer had started. I would take feedback from stakeholders and team members, then drive the user experience and design solutions to a place that met the goals of the project. Other times I was involved in future-thinking projects, participating in brainstorming and pitching of ideas, research and analysis, then prototyping and testing the ideas we came up with.</p>

        <p>An example of the work I did during this time is the book series details page. It's designed to show all the books in a series, allowing the customer to view and purchase them from one page. I was handed this project mid stream and worked closely with the project manager and stakeholders to flesh out the details of every aspect of the layout and user experience. It represents the kind of high-level thinking coupled with constant attention to detail that I try to bring to every project I work on.</p> -->

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Many popular books are part of a series, yet amazon didn’t have an easy way for the shopper to see and purchase each book in a series. The proposed solution was to create a page where all the books in a series could be seen at once, and added to a shopper’s cart. I started working on this project after it had started and was handed 1st draft designs that I needed to work from and iterate as the project evolved. </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>1.   Ask questions from the Project Manager, the original designer, and other team members to understand as fully as possible the details of the project, what’s the problem we are trying to solve, what technology are we using, what influenced the design decisions, what limited the design, what are the team dynamics, what’s frustrating people, what is motivating people? Then I take lots of notes.</p>
        <p>2.   I try to be selective in how I change the designs, focusing on addressing the issues that my team has asked me to focus on instead of just redesigning the whole to my liking. </p>

                    srcset="images/amz-03_1x.jpg 550w,

                    alt=""></div>
        <h5>Example of a user flow</h5>
        <p>3.   I addressed each issue by creating just enough documentation to show my thinking and present in meetings or over email without spending too much time mocking things up. I created user flows, and mocked up key pages in the flow, showing different states for different types of content, and different device sizes. All of this was created in Axure mock-ups that were accessible via URL in email or meeting notes, adapting to the tools and processes the Amazon team already used. These mockup included user flows, clickable design demos for desktop and mobile, and documentation of different states of UI features and content scenarios.</p>

                    images/amz-04_3x.jpg 1650w,
                    images/amz-04_4x.jpg 2200w"
                    src="images/amz-04_1x.jpg" 
                    alt=""></div>
        <h5>Axure mock up</h5>
        <p>4.   Part of my role was to support the work of the Project manager as she championed this feature across internal teams and stakeholders. I helped explain and defend our design decisions in meetings when the kindle team was skeptical of participating, I worked with the constraints of the search team, first by seeking out and interviewing a search team member who was an expert on dynamically generated search images to understand the technology behind how details images are generated, then reworking the design of the image to fit within the technical constraints. This went a long way to unblock the project and show stakeholders that it was viable to launch. </p>
        <p>5.   I also worked with a remote dev team in a different time zone and who spoke English as a second language, communicating effectively and making sure I kept their work unblocked by creating image assets to their specs and on time for their schedule.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>When my involvement in the project ended, I handed over design and UX files that were in good order, and made a series of deliverables that were available for all team members to view and could be relied upon as documentation of all the latest design decisions. The feature went live a year later in 2015. The latest version can be seen [live on Amazon.com].</p>
