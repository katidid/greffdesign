 <!--        <p>The main product we develop at Fitcode is an integrated user experience that lives on our partners websites. We partner with jeans brands by measuring and fit testing their inventory, adding our quiz experience to their website, and providing online shoppers with personalized fit recommendations as they shop and browse the site.</p> 

        <p>In developing this experience over the years I played many roles. I'd start with gathering requirements and goals for the product or feature improvement. Then I would do information architecture exercises, mapping out the product structure and user flows. Using all this info I'd create a rough black and white interactive mockup, something I could share with the team, and let them interact with and discuss.</p>

        <p>I'd work with my colleagues to gather feedback and continue the design process until I had a fully designed prototype that everyone was on board with. Then I'd work with the dev team to build the product, writing HTML and CSS to help implement the designs, and finding UX solutions to unforeseen details and design revisions that crop up. Finally when we were close to launching I'd lead a team bug bash, documenting each bug, and coordinating the triage and bug resolution effort before launch.</p> 

        <p>As our product has evolved and updated over time, I'd do this process continually, with every step trying to make sure our product was the highest possible quality, and as easy and delightful an experience as possible for our shoppers.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Previous iterations of this product were not performing as well as we were hoping and we needed to partner directly with jeans brands, creating an experience that could be customized to their brand.</p>
        <p>We needed a way bring Fitcode to shoppers, this technology was going to work best if it fit seamlessly into a shoppers existing habits rather then trying to draw people in to a separate Fitcode website. I needed to design an experience that helped users find a better fit, looked good looked trustworthy but also could be sold as a generic UX or be brand specific, and was easy to implement in code and did as little as possible to slow the partner sites load times.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>1. Did a user story brainstorm with team members and refined the set of features to an MVP we could implement in a timeframe that worked for the business.</p>
        <p>2.   Constructed user flows and sitemaps and reviewed with the team</p>

                        <h5>User flow for the most common user story, "I would like to buy a pair of jeans that fit."</h5>

                        <h5>Example of some of the graphics I would create to communicate with the team about issues that need to be thought through.</h5>
        <p>3.   Built a design file that accounted for each key step in the user flow, and for 4 screen sizes at each step. Reviewed designs with the team.</p>

            src="images/fcInt-09_1x.jpg" 
            alt="">
            <h5>Having organized and labeled design files was key to keeping track of each UI detail for each state, screen size, and parter brand.</h5>
        <p>4.   Created powerpoint style PDF deliverables that our biz dev team could review with the partner.</p>
        <div class="imgborder"><img 
                    srcset="images/fcInt-10_1x.jpg 550w,
                    images/fcInt-10_2x.jpg 1100w,

                    alt=""></div>
                    <h5>Example of a partner UX deck.</h5>
        <p>6.   After signoff from both our team and the partner I would work with the dev team to implement my designs in the code. Often I would help write CSS, organizing styles for type, buttons, colors, and layouts so the build reflected my design work. often I’d be able to understand and address dev issues with my designs as I worked. I also managed svg graphics an image file optimization. I was expected to commit my work in Git in a separate branch and coordinate with the dev team to merge my work in with the master branch.</p>
        <p>7.   I also coordinated a lot of the QA efforts related to the front end. Checking the experience on a small library of devices, and scheduling a “bug bash” with the team just before launch. I also advocated for feature bugs that I felt would affect the user’s experience of our product, but may have been aside in the past. I kept track of feature bugs in a separate backlog on our scrum board, and periodically combed through it with the team so see what the team would be willing to address when we had time.</p>
        <p>8.   Post launch I would maintain my design files and iterate as needs from the partners came up, or as new features were launched.</p>
        <p>9.   When a new partner would come on board I would create a new design file to make changes specific to their brand and website layout. And a new separate iteration would be built by the development team. As we worked we would need to maintain sperate yet integrated versions of the partner badge, some parts being specific to the partner’s site and some parts being universal design changes.</p>
        <p>10.  I would make sure that the latest design of each partner’s badge experience was captured in a PPT style PDF that was easy to share with the fitcode team and our partners alike. Making it easy to use as a reliable resource for accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>As we worked we captured some really positive user data that showed how much Fitcode was helping to steer shoppers towards styles that would fit them better. </p>
        <p>Find some good stats on how the partner badge performed against a regular partner experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fitcode boost sales by 200% </li>
            <li>and repeat business by 300%</li>
            <li>Decreased returns by 58%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though Fitcode ended up disbanding our plan for the next iteration of the partner experience was to have a boutique page on our partners site that would show the shopper only styles that would fit their figure.</p>
