        <h1>Fitcode Partner Integration</h1>
        <h4>Dec 2014 - Aug 2018
            <br> Role: UX/UI designer, Front-End Developer</h4>

        <p>At Fitcode our goal was to help people find a better fit in jeans when they shopped online. We measured and fit tested the inventory of a select list of jeans brands, provided a fit quiz to users, and recommended jeans that would flatter their figure type as they browsed the site. The first few iterations of this technology were not meeting our business needs though and we had to do a design overhaul to make a product that would work for a more partner-based business model.</p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>At the time we had a good proof of concept when you visited the Fitcode website, but we needed a way to bring Fitcode to shoppers. We needed a product that our business team could sell, and would perform for our partners, bringing measurable benefits to their business.</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>Early on the product team worked with the business team to determine what set of features would be acceptable for a minimum viable product. From that information I explored the architecture of the product and did a few user flows to flesh out how it was going to work. Though these assets weren’t referenced very often by the team, I worked on them anyway because they allowed me to memorize each feature and state of the Fitcode Badge, allowing me to speak to any structural issue or change during meetings and team conversations.</p>

        <h5>User flow for the most common user story, "I would like to buy a pair of jeans that fit."</h5>
        <p>I would also explore other topics of interest like how a user’s size would affect what recommendations they see, how our integrated experience would interact with a partner’s existing sizing tools, and what areas of the site were best to place our invitation to take the quiz.</p>
        <div class="imgborder"><img 
                    srcset="images/fcInt-08_1x.jpg 550w,

        <h5>Example of some of the graphics I would create to communicate with the team about scenarios that need to be thought through.</h5>
        <p>Working from designs I had done for the previous project, I reorganized my files to account for each state in each screen size breakpoint in the partner’s site. I also used time saving techniques like symbols and linked files for repeating elements. This way I could stay on top of each design detail and change without wasting time wrestling with my design tools.</p>

            src="images/fcInt-09_1x.jpg" 
            alt="">
            <h5>Having organized and labeled design files was key to keeping track of each UI detail for each state, screen size, and parter brand.</h5>
        <p>After reviewing drafts of my designs with the product team, the final designs were organized into a presentation ready PDF that we would review with the partner team.</p>
        <div class="imgborder"><img 
                    srcset="images/fcInt-10_1x.jpg 550w,
                    images/fcInt-10_2x.jpg 1100w,
                    images/fcInt-10_3x.jpg 1650w,
                    images/fcInt-10_4x.jpg 2200w"
                    src="images/fcInt-10_1x.jpg" 
                    alt=""></div>
                    <h5>Example of a partner UX deck.</h5>
        <p>When we got signoff from both our team and the partner I would work with the dev team to implement my designs in code. I would pitch in with the CSS work, organizing styles for type, buttons, colors, and layouts so the build matched my designs. I also worked on image optimization, using .svg assets where ever I could and making sure each visual element was as lightweight as possible. When I worked with the dev team I was expected to commit my work in Git and coordinate with the team lead whenever my branch was ready to merge with the master branch.</p>
        <p>As features and states were finished by the dev team I would switch gears and start testing for quality assurance, making sure the user had an experience we intended at every step. Just before launch day everyone on the product team would pitch in for a “bug bash” and we’d prioritize and fix any remaining bugs as a team.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The Fitcode Badge went live in 2017 and was integrated on several popular brand retail sites including Hudson, AG and JOE’S Jeans. Over time we captured some really positive user data. Sites that used Fitcode’s recommendation badge saw a boost in sales by 200% and repeat business by 300%. Returns decreased by 58%. Here are the final designs and a video showing the Fitcode Badge in action.</p>
