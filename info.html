	<p>This portfolio is a showcase of work throughout my career. You’ll see my recent projects as well as ones dating back to the 2000s and 2010s. These are included to show my deep experience in the fields of web and graphic design, and to show work I'm still proud of to this day. I’ve worked in the Seattle area marketing and tech industries, both at agencies and in house. Some of the brands I’ve worked with include Starbucks, Target, Nordstrom, Microsoft, T-Mobile and more.</p>
	<p>When I'm not working as a designer and director I'm dabbling in photography,  screen printing and tinkering with code. In the past I sold my screen prints on Etsy and was more active on social media. Now I've simplified my life a bit while I raise two kids, but hope to become a creator again in the future.</p>
	<p>Please email me at <a href="mailto:katie@greffdesign.com">katie@greffdesign.com</a> if you'd like to get in touch. You can also learn more about me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/katiegreff">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
