<h1>How I Feel About Blog Titles</h1>
<h4>March 20th, 2014</h4>

<p>Recently I decided I needed to get back in the fray and brush up my web coding skills. I figured the best way to do it was to get my hands dirty and build a site, so I ended up taking some time every week to learn a little, and code a little, until I had something to show for it. In the end I was able to get a sense for the the latest best practices for writing HTML/CSS, and get some hands on experience in writing responsive code.</p>

<p>The site design and content is inspired from M. Sasek's wonderful children's book "This is San Fransisco" and is based on the Seattle neighborhood I live in. I did the illustrations in watercolor based on photos I took while exploring the streets and waterways of Ballard.</p>

<p>Nordstrom came to Übermind in early 2011 to give them a fresh presence mobile web space. I was part of a small team of developers and UX designers acting as the main designer in charge of the look and feel, brand execution and visual interface design for the website. I worked closely with the front-end developers, to make sure every aspect of my design was efficient enough to keep the load times down on slow mobile browsers, and worked closely with the brand team at Nordstrom to ensure that the look and feel of the site fit within the guidelines if their branded online experience. We had a chance to take what was an outdated feature phone website and turn it into a fully functional touch screen compatible mobile website in a matter of months. It was a really exciting project to be on.</p>

<p>When CNNMoney approached Übermind to do an iPad app they were looking for an app that would break new ground and make waves in the news & financial industry. I worked closely with a UX designer and a team of iOS developers to do formulate an tablet experience that was dynamic and tailored to the user's needs and habits. A trio of blades on the main screen could be expanded and pushed aside to reveal more or less information on the current financial markets, news and trending topics. Pushing all the blades to the side would reveal the users Watchlist tailored to the stocks and index's they cared about the most. The content that is served to the user gets refined based on what topics and stories they read the most, making this app a useful and delightful experience for casual market watchers and financial professionals alike.</p>
