		<p>Visit the This is Ballard Website.</p>

<p>Recently I decided I needed to get back in the fray and brush up my web coding skills. I figured the best way to do it was to get my hands dirty and build a site, so I ended up taking some time every week to learn a little, and code a little, until I had something to show for it. In the end I was able to get a sense for the the latest best practices for writing HTML/CSS, and get some hands on experience in writing responsive code.</p>

<p>The site design and content is inspired from M. Sasek's wonderful children's book "This is San Fransisco" and is based on the Seattle neighborhood I live in. I did the illustrations in watercolor based on photos I took while exploring the streets and waterways of Ballard.</p>
