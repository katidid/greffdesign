		<h1>Worktank Holiday-O-Matic</h1>
		<h4>Winter 2008</h4>

		<div class="pb"><p>As the holiday season approached the Worktank creative team was called upon to create a greeting for our clients, partners and friends that was fun, festive and memorable. We had a blast coming up with potential concepts, and ended up choosing the idea of a self generating holiday greeting card. This “Holiday-O-Matic” would alllow you to choose your own greeting or generate a random one for your amusement. I was involved in concepting, designing the print version which took the shape of a 3 wheel volvelle greeting card, and creating illustrations and graphics for use on both the card and online.</p></div>
