		<h1>Vartafore Business Papers</h1>
		<h4>2009</h4>

		<div class="pb"><p>Part of working in an agency environment is stepping in at different phases of a project and moving it forward. When we began working with Vertafore they had a new logo and basic brand guidelines prepared by another firm but needed to begin rolling out the new brand across their company. I studied the new brand guidelines and created a set of business papers that expanded upon the themes of energy, agility, and warmth that the brand identity contains. The letterhead and business card designs are neat, simple and professional, allowing the folder and back of the business cards to make a bold brand statement with the full-bleed use of the orange-yellow gradient.</p></div>
