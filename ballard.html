		<h1>This is Ballard</h1>
		<h4>September 2013</h4>

		<p>Recently I decided I needed to get back in the fray and brush up my web coding skills. I figured the best way to do it was to get my hands dirty and build a site, so I ended up taking some time every week to learn a little, and code a little, until I had something to show for it. In the end I was able to get a sense for the the latest best practices for writing HTML/CSS, and get some hands-on experience in writing responsive code.</p>

		<p>The site design and content is inspired from M. Sasek's wonderful children's book &ldquo;This is San Fransisco&rdquo; and is based on the Seattle neighborhood I live in. I did the illustrations in watercolor based on photos I took while exploring the streets and waterways of Ballard.</p>
